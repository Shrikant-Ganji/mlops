# MLOps Zoomcamp 2025

Welcome to the **MLOps Zoomcamp 2025** repository! This is a practical, project-based course for learning modern Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) with a real-world focus. Whether you're a data scientist, ML engineer, or developer, this course will equip you with the skills to take models from experiments to robust, deployable, and monitored production systems.

---

## üåü Why MLOps Zoomcamp?

Machine Learning is not just about building models, but about creating reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems. This course covers the entire MLOps lifecycle:
- Experimentation
- Pipeline orchestration
- Model deployment (batch/real-time)
- Monitoring & retraining
- Best software engineering practices

You‚Äôll gain real, hands-on skills by working through each phase using the NY Taxi dataset as a running example.
